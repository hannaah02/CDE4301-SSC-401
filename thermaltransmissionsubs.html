          The thermal tranmission subsystem is responsible for transferring the thermal energy from the receiver to the TES system. This includes the HTF, the connecting pipes, insulation of the pipes, and the pumps.

        <h3>Heat transfer fluid selection</h3>
        <p>
          The HTF is the medium that transfers the thermal energy from the receiver to the TES system. The list of potential HTF is narrowed down based on the operating temperature for the entire thermal transmission subsystem, which is between 60-80ÂºC. To rank these, the following criterias are considered:
          <ul>
            <li>Heat capacity: High heat capacity is ideal as more energy can be stored within the temperature range</li>
            <li>Viscosity: Low viscosity is ideal to reduce the friction head loss</li>
            <li>Cost: Low cost is ideal</li>
            <li>Availability: Easily available is ideal</li>
          </ul>

          <b>Title:</b> Flowing open system test with white LED
          <br /><br />
          <b>Purpose:</b> To attain the power absorbed by the HTF (water) and determine the ideal flow rate for a predetermined temperature change
          <br /><br />
          <b>Methodology:</b> Water is cycled through the cylindrical-conical receiver from one container to another and the temperature is measured for the water in both containers. The experiment starts when the white LED is switched on and is left until the outlet temperature reaches constant temperature. The details of the setup are below:
        </p>

        </table-component>
          
        <p>
          <b>Hypothesis:</b> The power will be higher for the flowing system than for the static system. 
          <br /><br />
          Compared to the static experiments in the light subsystem, the fluid in the flowing systems experiences forced convection rather than natural convection due to the presence of the working pump. The convective heat transfer coefficient accounts for the heat transfer between the inner surface of the copper coil and the fluid. In forced convection, the motion increases the rate at which the hot fluid at the surface is replaced by cooler fluid. This is seen in the higher value for convective coefficient in forced convection than the natural convection and the specific value can be obtained from the Nusselt number. Utilising the convection heat transfer equation,
